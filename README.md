# Learning Go with Advent of Code

This repository is a personal journey of learning Go by solving problems from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). The goal is to progressively improve Go skills while tackling a variety of programming challenges. Each part represents a new concept or challenge solved, and there will be multiple parts as I work through different problems.

## Overview

# Day 1
- **Part 1**: Basic file reading and string manipulation. This part covers how to read a file, find specific digits within lines of text, and manipulate data (extract, combine and calculate the sum).
- **Part 2** (Coming soon): 

## Structure

Each part will have its own folder with:
- The problem description.
- The solution code in Go.
- A short `README.md` explaining the approach and learnings.

## Running the Code

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thespecialone1/adventofcode

2. Navigate to the desired part folder:
    ```bash
    cd part-1

3. Run the go program
    ```bash
    go run main.go
